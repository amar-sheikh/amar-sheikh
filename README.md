👋 Hi, I’m Umar Sheikh — a senior full-stack developer with a focus on clean, scalable backend systems.

💻 I specialize in Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and background jobs (Sidekiq, Redis), with production experience across startups and SaaS platforms.

🔧 I enjoy fixing legacy codebases, building internal tools, and shipping features that actually move the needle.

📊 I've helped scale scraping and enrichment platforms, keyword ranking systems, and real-time sports data APIs.

🛠️ I value maintainability, test coverage, and well-defined service boundaries over clever abstractions.

🚀 I’m comfortable working async with founders, CTOs, or small teams — from audit to architecture to implementation.

🔍 Recent work: Grafo.io (cold outreach), SportsEngine.com (live scores), Ginzametrics (SEO intelligence).

🤝 Available for short-term consulting, audits, and high-impact feature delivery.

🌍 Based in Pakistan, async-friendly, timezone-flexible.
